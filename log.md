# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 06, 2020 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I started to rewrite my one of my favorite projects in Golang, my serverless boilerplate example to scale teams to use Lambda and Golang. 

**Thoughts:** Code using best pratices in go is very difficult in the beginning. It's hard to use local modules with go dep or go mod. I spend a lot of time to learn thw best way to do this.
